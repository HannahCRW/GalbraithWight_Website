		<h4>“He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever,” - Chinese Proverb</h4>


<p>The global healthcare industry is facing greater challenges than ever before. With rising clinical development costs, declining drug discovery success rates, greater challenges for reimbursement and pricing for new medicines, growing numbers of cheaper generic alternatives and increasing demand for evidence-based personalised treatments. If you do not have a thorough understanding of how each of these challenges will affect you then you are simply stumbling around in the dark. This is why independent market research undertaken by experts in the healthcare industry is essential.</p>
