		<h4>The successful launch of any new pharmaceutical brand must take into account the critical dimensions of brand, company and market. But most importantly of all, a coherent Market Access strategy must lie at the heart of all business and brand planning.</h4>

<strong>What is Brand &amp; Launch Excellence?</strong>
<p>GalbraithWight's Brand &amp; Launch Excellence framework enables you to effectively prepare the three critical dimensions of brand, company and market so that your new venture is as successful as it possibly can be.
In today’s continually-evolving and competitive global healthcare market, we believe that your brand strategies must be an area of focus all year round and not simply seen as a separate entity within a project.
We also believe that a comprehensive Market Access strategy must be properly embedded throughout the branding, product marketing, pre-launch and post-launch process. This is why we have embedded Market Access planning into the heart of our Brand &amp; Launch Excellence programme.</p>

<strong>How can we help?</strong>
<p>Our experience as a specialist global market access consultancy allows us to provide actionable recommendations, cross-functional training, decision making support, and ongoing partnership solutions.
By utilising our unique Decisions© framework - the first and only brand planning process designed with Market Access at its heart - we help our customers prepare their branding, company and marketing for launch excellence.
Our Decisions© Brand Planning process has been built to achieve six key objectives:
	<ul>
		<li>Put Market Access at the heart of business and brand planning, throughout the brand life cycle</li>
		<li>Drive a strategic lifecycle management approach to business and product branding strategy, from Phase II research to loss of exclusivity and beyond</li>
		<li>Develop critical thinking rather than a 'template - filling' exercise</li>
		<li>Ensure integration between global, regional and affiliate functions</li>
		<li>Help affiliates work collaboratively</li>
		<li>Encourage deeper 'joined up thinking' across cross-functional brand teams
		</li>
	</ul>
We have designed Decisions© so that it can be embedded within your organisation at global, regional or affiliate level, and can also be adapted to dovetail with existing processes.</p>
